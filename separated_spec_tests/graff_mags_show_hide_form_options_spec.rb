    As a user
    I want to be able to show or hide form fields
    So that I can control how much information to enter

  } do

    # Acceptance Criteria
    # User sees options to show/hide form fields
    # User can enter less or more information about each issue

        user = FactoryGirl.create(:user, role: 'admin')
        issue = FactoryGirl.build(:issue)

        sign_in_as(user)

        visit new_admin_issue_path

        expect(page).to have_selector(".issue-details", visible: false)
